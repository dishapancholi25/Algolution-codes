LIST OF Programs 
Set -1
Algolution 

1.	Write a program to count total number of negative numbers in an array.
2.	Write a program that takes 5 integers as input from the user and print Max of all the numbers.
3.	Write a program to merge two sorted arrays to a third array.
4.	Write a program that takes 7 integers as input from the user 
then Reverse the order of numbers in the array, then print the numbers.
5.	Write a program that takes 5 integers as input from the user 
and finds out if the order of numbers in array is palindrome
e.g. 
if input numbers are 44 56 56 44 then the array is in palindrome order
if input numbers are 44 53 156 44 then the array is not in palindrome order.

6.	Write a program to search a number (taken as input from user) in an array 
then print the index of the first occurrence of the input number in the array
If the input number is not present in the array then print -1
7.	Write a program to print all unique numbers in an array.
8.	Write a program to count frequency of each number in an array.
